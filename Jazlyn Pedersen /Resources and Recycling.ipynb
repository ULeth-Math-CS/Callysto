    "Solar energy is energy that comes from the sun. The earth recieves more energy from the sun in one hour than the whole world uses in one year. Solar energy is used to generate electricity using solar panels. A solar panel works by allowing particles of light to knock electrons free from atoms, generating a flow of electricity. Unfortunately, solar panels need solar cells to work which are created from already existing materials such as silicon, which is not an unlimited resource. \n",

The most common use of oil that you may know is gasoline for vehicles. Oil is a fossil fuel.

Chemical energy is trapped in the form of wood and other plant matter. Coal is also a source of chemical energy because when the plant matter died, it formed layers at the bottom of swamps. Water and dirt began to pile up on top of the dead plant remains and years of pressure formed the rock we call coal.\n",

Steam occurs when water heats up to such a high temperature that it changes from a liquid to a gas. Steam is kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, or in other words the movement of particles. The steam (or kinetic energy) causes a generator to spin and produces electrical energy. Coal is a fossil fuel making it nonrenewable. Humans use coal at a faster rate than it reproduces.\n",

    "Perhaps one of the oldest forms of fuel known is biomass fuel. Biomass is any kind of biological matter that humans can burn in order to produce heat or energy. Biomass mainly consists of wood, leaves, and grass. \n",
    "\n",
    "All biomass has storages of carbon and when biomass is burned the carbon is released into the atmosphere as CO2 gas. Resources such as wood, leaves and grass are NOT fossil fuels because biomass is said to be carbon neutral. Carbon neutral means that the amount of carbon released when biomass is burned is equal to the amount of carbon that is naturally needed in the environment for processes like photosynthesis. \n",
    "\n",
    "As humans we must remember that trees take years to grow so if we carelessly use wood, it may not always be a resource immediately available for use. When someone in Alberta cuts down a tree to burn it for energy, it is said that one tree must be planted to replace it. Humans across Canada work to replace trees at the rate in which we use them making biomass a renewable source.\n",

    "##### Biomass Fun Facts! \n",
    "1) If you’ve ever been near a campfire or a fireplace, you’ve witnessed biomass energy through the burning of wood.\n",

    "2) Biomass has been around since the beginning of time when man burned wood for heating and cooking.\n",

A hydro-dam produces electricity when water pushes a device called a turbine. This turbine spins a generator which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.

    "The energy produced by the Sun, for example, comes from nuclear fusion reactions. Hydrogen gas in the core of the Sun is squeezed together so tightly that four hydrogen particles combine to form one helium atom. This is called nuclear fusion. When one of these two physical reactions occurs (nuclear fission or nuclear fusion) the atoms experience a slight loss of mass. The mass that is lost becomes a large amount of heat energy and light. This is why the sun is so hot and shines brightly. Did you know that Albert Einstein discovered his famous equation, E = mc2, with the sun and stars in mind. In his equation, Einstein invented a way to show that \"Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared.\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "The heat generated in nuclear fusion and nuclear fission is used to heat up water and produce steam, which is then used to create electricity. The seperation and joining of atoms occurs safely within the walls of a nuclear power station. Nuclear power generates nuclear waste that can be dangerous to human health and the environment. \n"

The term 'geo' means earth and the word 'thermal' means heat, which means geothermal is 'heat from the earth.' Note, there exists a device called a geothermal heat pump that can tap into geothermal energy to heat and cool buildings. A geothermal heat pump system consists of a heat pump, an air delivery system (ductwork), and a heat exchanger-a system of pipes buried in the shallow ground near the building. In the summer, the heat pump moves heat from the indoor air into the heat exchanger. In the winter, the heat pump removes heat from the heat exchanger and pumps it into the indoor air delivery system. \n",

    "Why is geothermal energy a renewable resource? Because the source of geothermal energy is the unlimited amount of heat generated by the Earth's core. It is important that your realize that geothermal energy systems DO NOT get their heat directly from the core. Instead, they pull  heat from the crust—the rocky upper 20 miles of the planet's surface. "

    "Now that we understand each of the energy sources, it is important to weigh the good and the bad traits of each energy source. Discussing the good traits of an energy source makes it clear why it is efficient to use that technique of gathering usable energy. Efficient means the energy technique is achieving maximum productivity with minimum wasted effort or expense. Note that the bad traits of an energy source are usually negative side effects that we are trying to lessen or prevent while gathering usable energy.  \n",
