    "\n",
    "Let's look at our math exam mark example from above, the student correctly answered $22$ questions out of $25$, therefor the student received a grade of $\\dfrac{22}{25}$. To represent this ratio as a fraction we first convert $\\dfrac{22}{25}$ as it's decimal representation, simply do the division in your calculator. $$\\dfrac{22}{25} = 22 \\div 25 = 0.88$$ Ok we are almost done, we now have the ratio represented as a value between 0 and 1. To finish getting the answer to our problem all we need to do is multiply this value by $100$ to get our percentage. $$0.88 \\times 100 = 88\\%$$\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in this notebook, percentages show up in many different ways and are very useful when describing a ratio. It allows for demonstrating any ratio on a familiar scale ($100$) to make data easier to understand. In this notebook we covered the following: \n",
    " -A percentage simply represents a fraction\n",
    " -To convert any fraction to a percent we turn it into it's decimal form and add $100$\n",
    " -A percentage of an amount is simply a fraction multiplication problem\n",
    " -To add or subtract a percentage of an amount we first find the percent value than add/subtract from the original value\n",
    " -When adding a percentage to an amount we an use the decimal form of percent and add $1$ to it (for example $\\$12\\times(0.05+1)=\\$12.60$)\n",
    " \n",
    " Keep practicing converting fractions to percentages and it will eventually become second nature!"
