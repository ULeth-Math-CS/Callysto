    "- Most headers also create links which reopens the same notebook, these links should proably be removed or ignored.\n",
    "- Images tags must be `<image source=\"\">` format in the xml file. `<img src=\"\">` gets ignored when converting.\n",
    "- The image source has to be relative to where the final notebook will be.\n",
    "- `<solution>` tags create a dead hyperlink, can not reveal or show the solution. Needs to be turned into a `<statement>` to view.\n",
    "- `<aside>` tags do not show up, they are added to the html cells but do not show up when rendered.\n",
