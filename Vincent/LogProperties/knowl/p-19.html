<p>There are a couple of different ways to understand why <a href="LogProperties.html#algproplogfcns" class="xref" alt="Section 1.4 Algebraic Properties of Logarithmic Functions" title="Section 1.4 Algebraic Properties of Logarithmic Functions">Theorem 1.4</a> is true. Consider the product rule: \(\log_{b}(uw) = \log_{b}(u) + \log_{b}(w)\text{.}\) Let \(a = \log_{b}(uw)\text{,}\) \(c = \log_{b}(u)\text{,}\) and \(d = \log_{b}(w)\text{.}\) Then, by definition, \(b^{a} = uw\text{,}\) \(b^{c} = u\) and \(b^{d} = w\text{.}\) Hence, \(b^{a} = uw = b^{c} b^{d} = b^{c+d}\text{,}\) so that \(b^{a} = b^{c+d}\text{.}\) By the one-to-one property of \(b^{x}\text{,}\) we have \(a = c+d\text{.}\) In other words, \(\log_{b}(uw) = \log_{b}(u) + \log_{b}(w)\text{.}\) The remaining properties are proved similarly. From a purely functional approach, we can see the properties in <a href="LogProperties.html#algproplogfcns" class="xref" alt="Section 1.4 Algebraic Properties of Logarithmic Functions" title="Section 1.4 Algebraic Properties of Logarithmic Functions">Theorem 1.4</a> as an example of how inverse functions interchange the roles of inputs in outputs. For instance, the Product Rule for exponential functions given in <a href="LogProperties.html#algpropexpfcns" class="xref" alt="Section 1.3 Algebraic Properties of Exponential Functions" title="Section 1.3 Algebraic Properties of Exponential Functions">Theorem 1.3</a>, \(f(u+w) = f(u)f(w)\text{,}\) says that adding inputs results in multiplying outputs. Hence, whatever \(f^{-1}\) is, it must take the products of outputs from \(f\) and return them to the sum of their respective inputs. Since the outputs from \(f\) are the inputs to \(f^{-1}\) and vice-versa, we have that that \(f^{-1}\) must take products of its inputs to the sum of their respective outputs. This is precisely what the Product Rule for Logarithmic functions states in <a href="LogProperties.html#algproplogfcns" class="xref" alt="Section 1.4 Algebraic Properties of Logarithmic Functions" title="Section 1.4 Algebraic Properties of Logarithmic Functions">Theorem 1.4</a>: \(g(uw) = g(u) + g(w)\text{.}\) The reader is encouraged to view the remaining properties listed in <a href="LogProperties.html#algproplogfcns" class="xref" alt="Section 1.4 Algebraic Properties of Logarithmic Functions" title="Section 1.4 Algebraic Properties of Logarithmic Functions">Theorem 1.4</a> similarly. The following examples help build familiarity with these properties. In our first example, we are asked to “expand” the logarithms. This means that we read the properties in <a href="LogProperties.html#algproplogfcns" class="xref" alt="Section 1.4 Algebraic Properties of Logarithmic Functions" title="Section 1.4 Algebraic Properties of Logarithmic Functions">Theorem 1.4</a> from left to right and rewrite products inside the log as sums outside the log, quotients inside the log as differences outside the log, and powers inside the log as factors outside the log.</p>
