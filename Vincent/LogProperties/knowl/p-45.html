<p>As we would expect, the rule of thumb for re-assembling logarithms is the opposite of what it was for dismantling them. That is, if we are interested in rewriting an expression as a single logarithm, we apply log properties following the usual order of operations: deal with multiples of logs first with the Power Rule, then deal with addition and subtraction using the Product and Quotient Rules, respectively. Additionally, we find that using log properties in this fashion can increase the domain of the expression. For example, we leave it to the reader to verify the domain of \(f(x) = \log_{3}(x-1) - \log_{3}(x+1)\) is \((1,\infty)\) but the domain of \(g(x) = \log_{3}\left(\frac{x-1}{x+1}\right)\) is \((-\infty, -1) \cup (1, \infty)\text{.}\)</p>
