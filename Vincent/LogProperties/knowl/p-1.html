<p>In <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "IntroExpLogs"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span><a href="" class="xref" alt="" title="">Section </a>, we introduced the logarithmic functions as inverses of exponential functions and discussed a few of their functional properties from that perspective. In this section, we explore the algebraic properties of logarithms. Historically, these have played a huge role in the scientific development of our society since, among other things, they were used to develop analog computing devices called <a class="url" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule" target="_blank"><em class="emphasis">slide rules</em></a> which enabled scientists and engineers to perform accurate calculations leading to such things as space travel and the <a class="url" href="http://www.redorbit.com/news/space/73297/nasa_marks_35th_anniversary_of_first_moon_landing/" target="_blank"><em class="emphasis">moon landing</em></a>. As we shall see shortly, logs inherit analogs of all of the properties of exponents you learned in Elementary and Intermediate Algebra. We first extract two properties from <span>&lt;&lt;Unresolved xref, reference "logfcnprops"; check spelling or use "provisional" attribute&gt;&gt;</span><a href="" class="xref" alt="" title="">Theorem </a> to remind us of the definition of a logarithm as the inverse of an exponential function.</p>
