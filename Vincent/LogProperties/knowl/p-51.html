<p>While, in the grand scheme of things, both change of base formulas are really saying the same thing, the logarithmic form is the one usually encountered in Algebra while the exponential form isn't usually introduced until Calculus. The authors feel so strongly about showing students that every property of logarithms comes from and corresponds to a property of exponents that we have broken tradition with the vast majority of other authors in this field. This isn't the first time this happened, and it certainly won't be the last.</p>
