<p>A couple of remarks about <a knowl="./knowl/expandlogex.html" knowl-id="xref-expandlogex" alt="Example 1.1 Expanding logarithmic expressions" title="Example 1.1 Expanding logarithmic expressions">Example 1.1</a> are in order. First, while not explicitly stated in the above example, a general rule of thumb to determine which log property to apply first to a complicated problem is “reverse order of operations.” For example, if we were to substitute a number for \(x\) into the expression \(\log_{0.1} \left(10 x^2 \right)\text{,}\) we would first square the \(x\text{,}\) then multiply by \(10\text{.}\) The last step is the multiplication, which tells us the first log property to apply is the Product Rule. In a multi-step problem, this rule can give the required guidance on which log property to apply at each step. The reader is encouraged to look through the solutions to <a knowl="./knowl/expandlogex.html" knowl-id="xref-expandlogex" alt="Example 1.1 Expanding logarithmic expressions" title="Example 1.1 Expanding logarithmic expressions">Example 1.1</a> to see this rule in action. Second, while we were instructed to assume when necessary that all quantities represented positive real numbers, the authors would be committing a sin of omission if we failed to point out that, for instance, the functions \(f(x) = \log_{117}\left(x^2-4\right)\) and \(g(x) = \log_{117}(x+2) + \log_{117}(x-2)\) have different domains, and, hence, are different functions. We leave it to the reader to verify the domain of \(f\) is \((-\infty, -2) \cup (2,\infty)\) whereas the domain of \(g\) is \((2,\infty)\text{.}\) In general, when using log properties to expand a logarithm, we may very well be restricting the domain as we do so. One last comment before we move to reassembling logs from their various bits and pieces. The authors are well aware of the propensity for some students to become overexcited and invent their own properties of logs like \(\log_{117}\left(x^2-4\right) = \log_{117}\left(x^2\right) - \log_{117}(4)\text{,}\) which simply isn't true, in general. The unwritten (the authors relish the irony involved in writing what follows) property of logarithms is that if it isn't written in a textbook, it probably isn't true.</p>
