<p>This exercise is just about making sure you know how to use Sage.  Login to a Sage Notebook server and create a new worksheet.  Do some non-trivial computation, maybe a pretty plot or some gruesome numerical computation to an insane precision.   Create an interesting list and experiment with it some.  Maybe include some nicely formatted text or <span class="latex-logo">T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> using the included mini-word-processor of the Sage Notebook (hover until a blue bar appears between cells and then shift-click).</p>
<p>Use whatever mechanism your instructor has in place for submitting your work.  Or save your worksheet and then trade worksheets via email (or another electronic method) with a classmate.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sets-sage-exercises.html#exercise-30">in-context</a></span>
