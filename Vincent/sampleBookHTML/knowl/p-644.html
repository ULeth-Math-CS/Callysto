<p>Computing large powers can be very time-consuming. Just as anyone can compute \(2^2\) or \(2^8\text{,}\) everyone knows how to compute</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
2^{2^{1000000} }.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>However, such numbers are so large that we do not want to attempt the calculations; moreover, past a certain point the computations would not be feasible even if we had every computer in the world at our disposal. Even writing down the decimal representation of a very large number may not be reasonable. It could be thousands or even millions of digits long. However, if we could compute something like \(2^{37398332 } \pmod{ 46389}\text{,}\) we could very easily write the result down since it would be a number between 0 and 46,388. If we want to compute powers modulo \(n\) quickly and efficiently, we will have to be clever.</p>
