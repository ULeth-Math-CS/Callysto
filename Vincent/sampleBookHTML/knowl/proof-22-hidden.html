<body><article class="hiddenproof"><p>The main tools used in this proof are the division algorithm and the Principle of Well-Ordering. Let \(G\) be a cyclic group generated by \(a\) and suppose that \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\text{.}\) If \(H = \{ e \}\text{,}\) then trivially \(H\) is cyclic. Suppose that \(H\) contains some other element \(g\) distinct from the identity. Then \(g\) can be written as \(a^n\) for some integer \(n\text{.}\) Since \(H\) is a subgroup, \(g^{-1} = a^{n}\) must also be in \(H\text{.}\)  Since either \(n\) or \(-n\) is postive, we can assume that \(H\) contains positve powers of \(a\) and \(n \gt 0\text{.}\) Let \(m\) be the smallest natural number such that \(a^m \in H\text{.}\) Such an \(m\) exists by the Principle of Well-Ordering.</p>
<p>We claim that \(h = a^m\) is a generator for \(H\text{.}\)  We must show that every \(h' \in H\) can be written as a power of \(h\text{.}\) Since \(h' \in H\) and \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\text{,}\) \(h' = a^k\) for some integer \(k\text{.}\) Using the division algorithm, we can find numbers \(q\) and \(r\) such that \(k = mq +r\) where \(0 \leq r \lt m\text{;}\) hence,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
a^k = a^{mq +r} = (a^m)^q a^r = h^q a^r.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>So \(a^r = a^k h^{-q}\text{.}\) Since \(a^k\) and \(h^{-q}\) are in \(H\text{,}\) \(a^r\) must also be in \(H\text{.}\)  However, \(m\) was the smallest positive number such that \(a^m\) was in \(H\text{;}\) consequently, \(r=0\) and so \(k=mq\text{.}\) Therefore,</p>
<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
h' = a^k = a^{mq} =  h^q
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and \(H\) is generated by \(h\text{.}\)</p></article></body>
