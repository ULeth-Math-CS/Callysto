    "For many of the products that you use or buy, the standard way of indicating how much of a substance is present is to show the percentage (%) of weight or volume it represents. This are often found on foods or cleaners. Let's take milk for example. 1% milk means that 1% of the milk is milk fat, or in every 100ml of milk, there's 1ml of milk fat. That means if you have 1000ml or 1L of milk, then it contains 10ml of milk fat. \n",

    "\n",
    "Percentage is actually decribing \"parts per hundred\". 10% is the same as 10 parts per hundred or $\\frac{10}{100}$. This is very helpful for many everyday solutions, but some solutions are in much smaller concentrations than 1%. We could say that it has a concentration of 0.00001%, but there's a simpler way to show this. This percentage represents $\\frac{1}{1,000,000}$ which scientists use a unit to show this amount called parts per million (ppm). If you've already studied a pesticide called DDT, it's concentration is measured in parts per billion (ppb) because it can be deadly in even smaller concentrations.\n",

    "    Just like how 1000 g is equal to 1 kg, 1 ppm is equal to 1 mg/kg (milligram per kilogram). Theres 1000 milligrams in \n",

    "    differently in other solutions.\n",
    "\n",

    "If the nutritional information label on a container of yogurt specifies that each 125 g serving contains 7 mg of cholesterol, what is the concentration of cholesterol in a serving of yogurt in parts per million (ppm)? [source](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YJUpQYN2QlrzM0obSWKjdnMeFASNcKQb/view)\n",

    "1. First, state your information as a ratio.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are many substances that are toxic, meaning they are able to cause harm to organisms. They cause harm, not by how an organism is exposed to it, nor how long, but how much enters the organism. But it's hard to determine the concentration of the substance which is toxic because many factors influence it. Body mass and metabolism are two factors that affect when the concentration is considered toxic. It is easier to say what concentration would likely kill 50% of the population to which it's aplied. This is called the **lethal dose 50** or **LD50**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many scientists have done studies on what concentrations are harmful to humans. One of the first to do this was Paracelsus during the Renaissance. One of his famous quotes is *\"only the dose makes the poison\"*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a table of the LD50 of different chemicals for humans\n",
    "\n",
    "| Chemical        | Source | Concentration (ppm)|\n",
    "|-----------------|--------|--------------------|\n",
    "|botulinum toxin A|Clostridium botulinum bacterium|0.00000003|\n",
    "|   dioxin |contaminant in some herbicides and in PCBs|0.03|\n",

    "|  solanine  |green parts of potatoes|6.0|\n",
    "|  caffeine  |coffee, tea, chocolate|150-200|\n",
    "| NaCl | table salt | 12,357 |\n",
    "| glucose | sugar | 30,000 *(for rats)*|\n",
    "| H<sub>2</sub>O | water | 90,000 *(for rats)*|\n",
    "*Most of these are extrapolated from data of LD50 of rats or from observational data*\n",
    "\n",
    "You might notice that some things in this table you consume every day. Or you see other people consume these. Turns out, too much of anything can kill an organism. 90,000 ppm of water is around 6 litres for a healthy average adult. 200 ppm of caffiene is about 100 cups of coffee for that same adult. It's very difficult to get that kind of concentration within our bodies, so we consider that an **acceptable risk**."

    "### Case Study: DDT\n",
    "DDT or dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, is a pesticide originally created to kill lice which spread the disease typhus. It was so effective that they also used it to kill mosquitoes to reduce malaria. But what they didn't know when they were using it, was that this pesticide is persistent in the environment, ie. stays in the environment for really long periods or time. Then they decided to use it to control insect damage on crops. Then DDT gets into water supplies and eventually into the ocean in very small concentrations. But then small sea life such as zooplankton consume it. Instead of it being digested, this pestiside stays within their system and accumulates as they consume it. Then the small fish that eat plankton consume the DDT as well, and accumulate an even higher concentration within their fat cells. This goes all the way up the food chain, increasing the concentration in each organism, which is called **biomagnification**. And each step in the food chain, some of these organisms die because they consumed too much DDT and couldn't digest it. Humans have even been found to have small concentrations of DDT in our systems. We track the spread of DDT by calculating the concentration of DDT in certain areas and species."

If you want to know if something is acidic or basic, but not the exact pH, there is a test called litmus paper. Litmus paper comes in blue and red. The blue litmus paper turns red if it's dipped in an acid. The red litmus paper turns blue if it's dipped in a base. There's also a universal indicator solution which changes color at different pHs between 2 and 10. There's many more indicators such as phenolthalein, phenol red, bromothymol blue, and even cabbage juice. These all change color at different points on the pH scale."

    "They measure the concentration of carbon monoxide (from car exhaust) which is harmful in large amounts. They also measure the amount of ozone close to the earth. Ozone is good for us when it's 6-10 miles from the ground as it protects us from the sun's ultraviolet rays. But near the ground, ozone reacts with other chemicals to create harmful substances. If you've ever seen smog, ozone is one of its main components.\n",

    "* Concentration is in ppm, ppb, or ppt\n",
    "* LD50 is what concentration kills 50% of organisms that consume \n",
    "* DDT is an example of biomagnification\n",
    "* Acids are sour and have a pH less than 7\n",
    "* Bases are bitter and slippery and have a pH greater than 7\n",
    "* Concentration and pH are used to check the quality or water and air\n",
