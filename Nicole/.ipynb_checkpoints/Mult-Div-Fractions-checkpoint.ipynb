    "\n",
    "This is a notebook on multiplication and division by fractions. In this notebook, our primary focus will be on the procedural mechanics of these operations, but we'll also stop along the way to address a few conceptual problems. For example, the intuition we've developed from integer arithmetic tells us that multiplication should make a number bigger, and division should make it smaller. But this depends on the number we're multiplying/dividing by! (In particular, it depends on whether that number is greater or less than 1. Remember that fractions allow us to create numbers between 0 and 1 -- see (eventual link to CC-62 notebook?).)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will help you gain a conceptual understanding of the multiplication and division operations for fractions while developing mechanical proficiency in performing these operations. (But beware that one notebook is not enough! You will need plenty of practice before you master this topic.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find it helpful to review the visual and conceptual foundations of fraction multiplication before proceeding. If you have not already done so, take a few minutes to look at (eventual link to CC-83 notebook?).\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that (unlike addition) to multiply two fractions, we do **not** need them to have common denominators. The basic rule for fraction multiplication is as follows: multiply the corresponding numerators, do the same for the denominators, and then reduce, if necessary. (*Exception to the rule:* as we'll see below, it's usually easier to reduce -- that is, cancel common factors -- *before* you multiply.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying fractions is taking a small piece from an already small piece, for example we have half a bar of chocolate and want to eat half of what we have, but we want to know how much of the whole chocolate bar we are going to be eating. This word problem describes $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}$ and we'll learn methods on how to solve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rule for fraction multiplication is best understood by doing a few examples."

    "### How do we divide using fractions?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know how to multiply fractions, then you already know how to divide fractions!\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go back to dividing integers. We know that 10 divided by 2 is 5, because 10 can be split into 2 portions each of which has 5. Now notice that dividing 10 by 2 is the same as taking half of 10. That is,\n",
    "$$10\\div 2 = 10\\times \\frac12 = 5.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that in the equality $10 \\div 2 = 10\\times\\frac{1}{2}$, we took the reciprocal of the second number ($\\frac{2}{1} \\rightarrow \\frac{1}{2}$) then changed the division to multiplication! \n",
    "\n",
    "That's how division with fractions works too: flip the divisor and then multiply! This leads to:\n",
    "\n",
    "## The golden rule of division: *division is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal*\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, what is $10\\div \\frac{1}{3}$? If we apply the rule we just came up with, we find\n",
    "$$10\\div \\frac13 = 10\\times\\frac31 = 10\\times 3 = 30.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Does this make sense? Recall that when we compute $10\\div 2=5$, what we're working out is the number of groups of 2 we need to make 10. Similarly, the expression $10\\div \\frac13$ is asking how many $\\frac{1}{3}$ pieces can fit into 10 pieces. Since it takes 3 $\\frac{1}{3}$s to make one and 10 ones to make 10, we need $3\\times 10 = 30$ pieces of size $\\frac{1}{3}$ to make 10, therefore $10 \\div \\frac{1}{3} = 10 \\times 3 = 30$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here's the steps\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Step 1:\n",
    "Invert the divisor by making the numerator the denominator and the denominator the numberator of the second fraction.\n",
    "\n",

    "Follow the steps to multiply the fractions using either method mentioned earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### And you're done!\n",
    "\n",
    "### But why does this work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that division is the opposite of multiplication: dividing by a number \"undoes\" multiplication by that same number. Here, we are interested in undoing multiplication by fractions. Let's start with an integer example. Consider the multiplication of 10 by 4: $10 \\times 4 = 40$. To undo the multiplication by 4, we divide by 4: $40 \\div 4 = 10$ and we get back to the original number! Same goes for fractions: consider the product $20 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 10$. Dividing by $\\frac12$ should undo the multiplication. Our rule for division says that to divide by $\\frac{1}{2}$, we multiply by $\\frac21 = 2$: $10 \\div \\frac{1}{2} = 10\\times 2 = 20$. Once again, we get back to the original number!\n",
    "\n",
    "If dividing by 4 is equivalent to multiplying by $\\frac{1}{4}$, then it's true that dividing by $\\frac{1}{4}$ is equivalent to muliplying by 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "### But isn't division supposed to make the number smaller?\n",
    "\n",
    "The short answer is, \"Only if the number we're dividing by is bigger than 1.\" Try thinking of division as repeated subtraction: $2 \\div \\frac{1}{2}$ is asking how many times can we subtract $\\frac{1}{2}$ from 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "2 - \\frac{1}{2} &= 1\\frac{1}{2}\\tag{once}\\\\[5pt]\n",
    "1\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} &= 1\\tag{twice}\\\\[5pt]\n",

    "\\frac{1}{2} - \\frac{1}{2} &= 0\\tag{four times}\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So it took 4 subtractions of $\\frac{1}{2}$ from 2 to reach 0, therefore $2 \\div \\frac{1}{2} = 4$.\n",

    "With mixed numbers, we have to do a little more work, but it's only one more step:\n",
    "\n",
    "### For multiplication and division, all mixed numbers must be converted to improper fractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the product $\\frac45\\times 3\\frac14$. Mixed number notation is really shorthand for the sum of an integer and a fraction: $3\\frac14$ is really $3+\\frac14$. So one way to carry out the product is to use the distributive property:\n",
    "$$\\frac45 \\times 3\\frac14 = \\frac45(3+\\frac14) = \\frac45\\times 3+\\frac45\\times\\frac14 = \\frac{12}{5}+\\frac15 = \\frac{13}{5}=2\\frac35.$$\n",
    "(Note that we've made use of two skills practised above, without explicitly writing them down: we multiplied by 3 by thinking of it as the fraction $\\frac31$, and we cancelled the fours in the product $\\frac45\\times \\frac14$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "But that was quite a bit of work. The more efficient approach is as follows. First, we convert our mixed number to an improper fraction:\n",
    "$$3\\frac14 = 3+\\frac14 = 3\\times\\frac44+\\frac14 = \\frac{12}{4}+\\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{13}{4}.$$\n",
    "Next, we multiply using the methods we learned above:\n",
    "$$\\frac45\\times 3\\frac14 = \\frac45\\times\\frac{13}{4} = \\frac15\\times\\frac{13}{1}=\\frac{13}{5},$$\n",

    "Let's review what we've learned in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike addition, multiplication of fractions does *not* require common denominators. (As a result, many people find multiplication easier than addition when it comes to fractions!)\n",
    "- To multiply to fractions, simlply multiply the corresponding numerators and denominators, and then reduce if necessary.\n",
    "- The arithmetic is often simpler if you cancel common factors prior to multiplication.\n",
    "- Division is easily converted into multiplication. Remember the Golden Rule: division is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal!\n",
    "- Multiplication and division involving mixed numbers is most easily performed by first converting any mixed numbers to improper fractions.\n",
