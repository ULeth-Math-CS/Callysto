    "# Introduction to Poetry\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Grade 5 curriculum\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of types of poetry. We will look at a haiku (hi-koo), a diamante (dee-a-mon-tay) poem, a limerick (limm-r-ik), and a cinquain (sin-kain). Each one has a structure that makes it unique. Some poems have a certain number of syllables. Some poems need to rhyme, though not all poems need to rhyme. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Types of Poetry\n",
    "1. Shape poetry\n",
    "    - Makes a shape with the words in the poem\n",
    "    - This includes diamante and cinquain poems\n",
    "2. Rhyming poetry \n",
    "    - Has a rhyming pattern\n",
    "    - This includes limericks\n",
    "3. Haiku poetry\n",
    "    - Has a haiku form\n",
    "5. Narrative poetry\n",
    "    - A long poem telling a story\n",
    "4. Epic poetry\n",
    "    - A narrative poem about a hero on an adventure\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Syllables\n",
    "\n",
    "Syllables are parts of a word that are pronounced. For example, \"hello\" has 2 syllables: \"hel-lo\". \"Elephant\" has 3 syllables: \"el-e-phant\". Usually, every syllable has one vowel sound in it. Most vowels in words are not next to other vowels, so a single vowel, sometimes with consonants, is one syllable. Some vowel sounds are made with 2 vowels like \"pair\" which only has one syllable. There are some special words like naive (pronounced nI-Eve) has 2 vowel sounds next to each other. So \"naive\" has 2 syllables.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's different ways to tell how many syllables are in a word or sentence. \n",
    "1. How many times your mouth opens \n",
    "2. How a robot would speak \n",
    "3. Clapping with the syllables\n",
    "\n",
