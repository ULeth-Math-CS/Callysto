    "Divide and conquer is a highly versatile technique that generally lends itself very well to parallel algorithms design. You probably have seen the divide-and-conquer technique many times before this, but this is such an important technique that it is worth seeing it over and over again. It is particularly suited for “thinking parallel” because it offers a natural way of creating parallel tasks. In this notebook Students will learn to deal with sub problem and lead to an optimum solution."

    "\n",
    "An algorithmic technique. To solve a problem on an instance of size n, a solution is found either directly because solving that instance is easy (typically, because the instance is small) or the instance is separated into two or more smaller instances. Each of these smaller instances is solved and the solutions are combined to produce a solution for the original instance. The name divide and conquer is because the problem is conquered by dividing it into several smaller problems.\n",

    "Divide and conquer (from Latin dīvide et imperā) in politics and sociology is gaining and maintaining power by breaking up larger concentrations of power into pieces that individually have less power than the one implementing the strategy. The concept refers to a strategy that breaks up existing power structures, and especially prevents smaller power groups from linking up, causing rivalries and fomenting discord among the people. It was heavily used by British Empire in India and elsewhere.\n",

    "#### Elements of this technique involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "* creating or encouraging divisions among the subjects to prevent alliances that could challenge the sovereign\n",
    "* aiding and promoting those who are willing to cooperate with the sovereign\n",
    "* fostering distrust and enmity between local rulers\n",
    "* encouraging meaningless expenditures that reduce the capability for political and military spending\n",
