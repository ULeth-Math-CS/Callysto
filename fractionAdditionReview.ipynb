    "## Changes\n",
    "\n",
    " * Capitalized section headers.\n",
    " * Fixed a lot of punctuation errors.\n",
    " * Fixed consistency of verb tenses (\"3 slices are left\" vs. \"3 slices were left\").\n",
    " * Fixed broken images. Changed references to 'assets' folder to 'images'.\n",
    " * Increased size of parentheses in LaTeX equation.\n",
    " * Changed instances of \"let us\" to \"let's\" for consistency.\n",
    " * Changed \"real number\" to simply \"number\". A student who is just learning about fractions won't know about real numbers. Real numbers are introduced in later grade levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    " * The learning outcome for the notebook was to \"develop a visual understanding of fraction addition,\" but you used very few visualizations except at the end.\n",
    " * Insert some visualizations in the early sections.\n",
    "    * Show how we can represent, say, the fraction 2/3 by cutting a rectangle into 3 pieces and coloring in 2. This is consistent with the rectangles in the animation in the last section.\n",
    "    * <s>Or where you reference eating 3/8 of a pizza, a visualization of a pizza with 3/8 eaten.</s>\n",
    " *<s> 'numDenom.png' should be placed in the introduction where you first review the terms numerator and denominator</s>\n",
    " * <s>Include pictures with your pizza examples. This would also reinforce the idea that students should draw pictures to help solve math problems.</s>\n",
    " * Online calculators rate the difficulty of different sections of this notebook anywhere between a 7th and 12th grade reading level.\n",
    "    * There are a lot of long compound sentences with \"and\" that could be broken into two sentences.\n",
    "    * There are a lot of parenthetical that could be worked into the paragraphs differently.\n",
    " * <s>Grammar errors in all of Pixel Cat's speech bubbles. These are my suggested edits:</s>\n",
