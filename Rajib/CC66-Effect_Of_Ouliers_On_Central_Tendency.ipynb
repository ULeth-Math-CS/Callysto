    "# Effect of Outliers on Central Tendency\n",
    "This notebook(CC-66) will explore the effect of outliers on central tendency (mean, median, and mode).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is organized as follows. In section 1, we discuss the preliminaries, definition of outliers and followed by two primary examples. In the next section,  we first compute the basic central tendency without outliers by importing data set from local folder. In section 3, once we've covered the basics, you'll have the opportunity to use some basic Python tools to adjust a dataset by adding one or more outliers, and then observe the effect on mean, median, and mode. In the following section, we use python library as a data source. In section 5, we summarized the notebook. Section 6, represents the exercises problem for students. \n",

    "Marks $= 78, 87, 85, 96, 84, 92, 102, 79, 81, 97$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the data set there is no data that is too smaller or larger than the other values. But as we are given the full marks of the exam was out of $100$ that means an individual cen get at best $100$ mark in the course. So, the mark that exceed this maximum range would be fraud value in the data set. Therefore, $102$ is the outlier in the data set.  "

That is why we sum up all numbers it produce the result so high. On the contrary, to find out the median value we need to considere the middle number(s), that is why it moves to the right and will increase a bit. But the mode is very unlikely to update, because we define mode by the repetition. Input a very large number as an outlier and observe the histogra.
