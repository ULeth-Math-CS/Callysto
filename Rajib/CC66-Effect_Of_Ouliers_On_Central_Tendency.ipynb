In the next section,  we first compute the basic central tendency without outliers by importing data set from local folder. In section 3, once we've covered the basics, you'll have the opportunity to use some basic Python tools to adjust a dataset by adding one or more outliers, and then observe the effect on mean, median, and mode. In the following section, we use python library as a data source. In section 5, we summarized the notebook. Section 6, represents the exercises problem for students. \n",

Because to determine the mean value we need to add all values.  Otliers are the numbers that does not belong into the regular values. Generally it would be a large number. That is why we sum up all numbers it produce the result so high. On the contrary, to find out the median value we need to considere the middle number(s), that is why it moves to the right and will increase a bit. But the mode is very unlikely to update, because we define mode by the repetition. Input a very large number as an outlier and observe the histogra. You will notice all regular data should be in one particular area and the inputted value is far away. "
