        "explaination" : "1. First we look at how many ways to rearrage APPLE. Since apply has 5 letters, we know it's 5!. However, there are two P's so we must divide by 2!. Now we subtract the number of ways we can arrange APPLE where two P's ARE togther. If we consider the P's as one letter we get 4! since there would 4 letters (A{PP}LE). Therefore we have:"

        "solution" : "$$2! = 2$$",
        "explaination" : "2. Since there are only two different makes of cars and they have to be together, we can group all the Aston Martins as one object and all the Porches as one object. Therefore we have 2 objects. How many different ways can we arrange 2 objects?: "

        "solution" : "$$9! - 7! = 357840$$",

If we consider the Rowling books as one object, we have 9 objects altogther. Therefore we have 9! number of ways to rearrange the objects with no restrictions on Tolkien books. Now we subtract the number of ways we can arrange the objects when the Tolkien books ARE beside each other. If we consider the Tolkien books as one object, then we have 7 objects or 7! ways to arrange the books. Therefore we have:"
